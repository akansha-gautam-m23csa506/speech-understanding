      "iteration i: 174 | transcript: Simple as this proposition is, it is necessary to be stated,\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 296 | transcript: Of these, the debtors, male and female, formed a large proportion.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 297 | transcript: The frequency and extent of processes against debtors 70 or 80 years ago will appear almost incredible.\n",

      "iteration i: 326 | transcript: These courts were open to many and grave objections.\n",

      "iteration i: 327 | transcript: The commissioners who presided were, quote, little otherwise than self elected.\n",

      "iteration i: 481 | transcript: On the master's side, it was 13 and 4pence and a gallon of beer on entrance, although mister Newman\n",

      "iteration i: 484 | transcript: Numerous tyrannies were practiced on all who would not and could not pay the garnish.\n",

      "iteration i: 486 | transcript: And so were unable either to warm themselves or to cook their food.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 487 | transcript: Besides these fees, legitimate and illegitimate, there were others which must be paid before release.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 488 | transcript: The sheriff demanded 4 shillings 6p for his liberate, the jailer, 6 shillings 10p more and the turnkey, 2 shillings.\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 492 | transcript: Nor was nonpayment made a pretext for further imprisonment, thanks to the humanity of the jailer or the funds provided by various charities.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 493 | transcript: There was this much honest forbearance in Newgate in these days.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 495 | transcript: These were lumped together into a general fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 496 | transcript: And a calculation made as to the amount that might be expended per week from the whole sum, so that the latter might last out the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 497 | transcript: It generally ran to about £6 per week. The money, which at 1 time had been distributed quarterly and all went in drink,\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 498 | transcript: Was after 18/07 through the exertions of the keeper of the jail spent in the purchase of necessaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 499 | transcript: But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtor's side was crowded, as it often was.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 500 | transcript: Notably, as when numbers filled Newgate in anticipation of Lord Reddale's bill for insolvent debtors.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 501 | transcript: And there were as many as 350 prisoners in at one time.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 503 | transcript: Issued once a week, and divided as far as it would go, a very precarious and uncertain ration.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 504 | transcript: The bread was issued every alternate day. And while some prisoners often ate their whole allowance at once,\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 505 | transcript: Others who arrived just after the time of distribution were often 48 hours without food. The latter might also be 6 days without meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 506 | transcript: Share in the weekly allowance of meat might also be denied to debtors who had not paid garnish, as well as in the weekly grant from the charitable fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 507 | transcript: Hence, starvation stared many in the face, unless friends from outside came to their assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 508 | transcript: Or, the keeper made them a special grant of 6p per diem out of the common stock,\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 509 | transcript: Or the 6p allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 510 | transcript: The poor debtors were not supplied with beds. Those who could pay the price might hire them from each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 511 | transcript: Or from persons who made a trade of it. Or they might bring their beds with them into the prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 512 | transcript: Failing any of these methods, seeing that straw was forbidden for fear of fire, they had to be satisfied with a couple of the rugs provided by the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 513 | transcript: The supply of which was, however, limited, and there were not always enough to give bedding to all. The stock was diminished by theft.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 514 | transcript: Female visitors carried them out of the prisons, or the debtors destroyed them when the weather was warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 515 | transcript: And they were not in great demand in order to convert them into mop heads or cleaning rags.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 516 | transcript: Sometimes, rugs were urgently required and not forthcoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 517 | transcript: A severe winter set in. The new stock had not been supplied by the contractors and the poor debtors perished of cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 518 | transcript: Again, there was no regular allowance of fuel. Coals were purchased out of the garnish money and the charitable fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 519 | transcript: So were candles, salt, pepper, mops and brooms. But the latter could have been of little service. Dirt prevailed everywhere.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "iteration i: 778 | transcript: By this means spirits, otherwise unattainable and strictly prohibited, were smuggled into the jail.\n",

      "iteration i: 792 | transcript: Owing to the facility of intercourse between inside and outside, many crimes were doubtless hatched in Newgate.\n",

      "iteration i: 796 | transcript: These malpractices were fostered by the absence of all supervision and the generally unbroken idleness.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 819 | transcript: For giving every prisoner a sleeping cell to himself, an amount of enlightenment, which is hardly general among European nations at this.\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 826 | transcript: The provision of more baths was also suggested, and the daily sweeping out of the prison.\n",

      "iteration i: 828 | transcript: But as yet, no suggestion was made to provide prison uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 829 | transcript: A laundry should be established, and a matron appointed on the female side, where all the prisoners' washing could be performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 830 | transcript: Proper hours for locking and unlocking prisoners should be insisted upon.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 832 | transcript: Committee took upon itself to lay down stringent rules for the discipline of the prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 833 | transcript: The jailer should be required to visit every part and see every prisoner daily. The chaplain should perform service, visit the sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 834 | transcript: Instruct the prisoners, quote, give spiritual advice and administer religious consolation, end quote, to all who might need them.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 835 | transcript: The surgeon should see all prisoners, whether ill or well, once a week and take general charge of the infirmaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 836 | transcript: All 3 governor, chaplain and surgeon should keep journals, which should be inspected periodically by the visiting magistrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 837 | transcript: It should be peremptorily forbidden to the keeper or any officer to make a pecuniary profit out of the supplies of food, fuel, or other necessaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 838 | transcript: No prisoner should be allowed to obtain superior accommodation on the payment of any fees. Fees indeed should be generally abolished. Garnish also.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 839 | transcript: No prisoners should in future be ironed, except in cases of misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 840 | transcript: Provided only that their security was not jeopardized and dependent upon the enforcement of another new rule,\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 841 | transcript: Recommended restrictions upon the number of visitors admitted,\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 842 | transcript: No wine or beer should be in future admitted into or sold in the jail.\n",

      "iteration i: 844 | transcript: Drunkenness, if it ever occurred, should be visited with severe punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 845 | transcript: Gaming of all sorts should be peremptorily forbidden under heavy pains and penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 846 | transcript: The feelings of the condemned prisoners should no longer be outraged by their exposure in the chapel, and the chapel should be rearranged.\n",

      "iteration i: 847 | transcript: So that the various classes might be seated separately and so as not to see each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 851 | transcript: The stateside ceased to exist, and the female prisoners thus regained the space of which their quadrangle had been robbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 852 | transcript: The privileges of the master's side also disappeared. Fees were nominally abolished and garnish was scotched, although not yet killed outright.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 853 | transcript: A certain number of bedsteads were provided, and there was a slight increase in the ration of bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 854 | transcript: But here the recommendations touched at once upon the delicate subject of expense, and it is clear that the committee hesitated on this score.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 855 | transcript: It made this too the excuse for begging the most important issue of the whole question.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 856 | transcript: Committee did not deny the superior advantages offered by such prisons as Gloucester and Petworth.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "iteration i: 861 | transcript: Committee does not seem to have yet understood that Newgate could be only and properly replaced,\n",

      "iteration i: 865 | transcript: All chances of classification and separation vanished, and the greatest evils remained untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "iteration i: 866 | transcript: All the committee could do in this respect was to throw the responsibility on others.\n",
